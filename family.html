				  	He was in search of a more physical holistic approach to build strength and avoid surgery. John connected with Bikram yoga, finding the series beneficial for building strong healthy body and mind.  In fall of 2003, John completed his teacher certification for Bikram yoga.

Today, John is pain free and believes “the yoga just works,” as he saw the change in himself and continues to see it in others.

					<p>Francesca was born in Napoli, Italy, and moved to the US in 2001. She began her yoga practice in 2006 in efforts to improve her flexibility while riding jumper and race horses.  After a severe injury during a horse race, she turned to Bikram yoga for rehabilitation.  As she continued her yoga practice, Francesca started feeling great improvement with her herniated disc, body flexibility, and mental well-being.  She decided to put all her attention on becoming a yoga instructor in hopes of helping others heal with this ancient art as she did.  Francesca moved to Miami from Brooklyn in August 2012.  From there, she quickly traveled to Los Angeles for her Bikram Yoga Teacher Certification.  Now an energized, passionate and strong teacher, she is happy and grateful to be spreading this beautiful practice, eager as ever to learn, grow and inspire students in their experience of the magic she herself continues to enjoy.

					<h3>Lina Dinkova</h3>
					<h4>Bikram Yoga / Bikram 60</h4>
					<p>Lina was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and moved to Miami, FL in her early teens.  A few years later, she discovered the practice of hot yoga, which became a vital part of her life.  She remained a practitioner for about 8 years before deciding to become a teacher.  She attended the strenuous and sweaty "Bikram Yoga Teacher Training 2014" in California.  The call for this pivotal step came from the realization that practicing yoga has changed her life in so many positive ways and continues to do so everyday.  Since then, Lina has traveled on numerous occasions to Costa Rica and California for yoga retreats, fully immersing herself in various spiritual and health disciplines such as: raw food diet, vegan diet, meditation, sun gazing, restorative yoga, kundalini yoga, yin yoga, qi gong (life energy cultivation), earthing (walking barefoot), breathing techniques, plant medicine, appreciation for nature, non-judgement and compassion.

					<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#" id="2">more</a> <span class="read-more-content">

				   	Lina is a cheery, compassionate and detail oriented instructor, making her an ideal match for beginner students as well as more experienced practitioners.

					"I like my students to have fun in my classes, gaining a deeper understanding of the practice of yoga and leaving with 100% of what they came for: that feeling of well being and accomplishment, the ability to quiet the mind and realize how much they are really capable of.”

					<p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who wanted to integrate three very important aspects of his life.  Body, mind and spirit.  The search began when one good day he discovered a book about metaphysics in his native Puerto Rico.  He found the information provided by this book and many others so amazing that it opened a whole new way of thinking, reminding him of how powerful human beings truly are.  The search continued and one thing let to another until one day, watching TV in Chicago, he came across a tall and skinny woman with a sweet voice doing a series of stretches. “WOW" he said to himself, “This looks interesting.”  He began stretching with her and soon learned these stretches were called Yoga!!  After a decade of consistent practice, Willy became a certified vinyasa instructor and has been teaching for 10 years.</p>

				<p>John’s yoga journey began in 2001 in an effort to heal old discomforting injuries.
				He was in search of a more physical holistic approach to build strength and avoid surgery. John connected with Bikram yoga, finding the series beneficial for building strong healthy body and mind.  In fall of 2003, John completed his teacher certification for Bikram yoga.  His personal story inspired him to teach, as he knew first hand the healing power of a consistent dedicated daily yoga practice.  Johns passion for the practice grows as he observes and guides his students through their own experience, bearing witness to constant progress and evolution.  Today, John is pain free and believes “the yoga just works,” as he saw the change in himself and continues to see it in others.  Now a world traveling instructor, Johns knowledge, humor, and contagious enthusiasm will make you crave his class, as he always leaves you challenged and wanting more.

				<p>Francesca was born in Napoli, Italy, and moved to the US in 2001. She began her yoga practice in 2006 in efforts to improve her flexibility while riding jumper and race horses.  After a severe injury during a horse race, she turned to Bikram yoga for rehabilitation.  As she continued her yoga practice, Francesca started feeling great improvement with her herniated disc, body flexibility, and mental well-being.  She decided to put all her attention on becoming a yoga instructor in hopes of helping others heal with this ancient art as she did.  Francesca moved to Miami from Brooklyn in August 2012.  From there, she quickly traveled to Los Angeles for her Bikram Yoga Teacher Certification.  Now an energized, passionate and strong teacher, she is happy and grateful to be spreading this beautiful practice, eager as ever to learn, grow and inspire students in their experience of the magic she herself continues to enjoy.  In April 2015, Francesca became the mother to a beautiful baby girl named Oriana.  Through daily practice with her mother, Oriana is already learning breath meditation and many asanas.  Francesca feels deeply blessed with this amazing miracle of life! </p>

				<p>Lina was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and moved to Miami, FL in her early teens.  A few years later, she discovered the practice of hot yoga, which became a vital part of her life.  She remained a practitioner for about 8 years before deciding to become a teacher.  She attended the strenuous and sweaty "Bikram Yoga Teacher Training 2014" in California.  The call for this pivotal step came from the realization that practicing yoga has changed her life in so many positive ways and continues to do so everyday.  Since then, Lina has traveled on numerous occasions to Costa Rica and California for yoga retreats, fully immersing herself in various spiritual and health disciplines such as: raw food diet, vegan diet, meditation, sun gazing, restorative yoga, kundalini yoga, yin yoga, qi gong (life energy cultivation), earthing (walking barefoot), breathing techniques, plant medicine, appreciation for nature, non-judgement and compassion.  
				Lina is a cheery, compassionate and detail oriented instructor, making her an ideal match for beginner students as well as more experienced practitioners.
				<br>	
			    "I like my students to have fun in my classes, gaining a deeper understanding of the practice of yoga and leaving with 100% of what they came for: that feeling of well being and accomplishment, the ability to quiet the mind and realize how much they are really capable of.”</p>

				<p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who wanted to integrate three very important aspects of his life.  Body, mind and spirit.  The search began when one good day he discovered a book about metaphysics in his native Puerto Rico.  He found the information provided by this book and many others so amazing that it opened a whole new way of thinking, reminding him of how powerful human beings truly are.  The search continued and one thing let to another until one day, watching TV in Chicago, he came across a tall and skinny woman with a sweet voice doing a series of stretches. “WOW" he said to himself, “This looks interesting.”  He began stretching with her and soon learned these stretches were called Yoga!!  After a decade of consistent practice, Willy became a certified vinyasa instructor and has been teaching for 10 years.</p>

				Once in Miami, after suffering two bike accidents and working long hours as a waitress and bartender, Julia started taking Pilates Mat and Restorative Yoga. She was instantly hooked on how great she felt, choosing to then complete her Power Pilates Mat certification through Power Pilates, New York. While practicing Bikram yoga in Miami, she was introduced to Hot Pilates, became addicted to the practice and completed her Inferno Hot Pilates training in Chicago with the creator herself, Gabriella Walters. 
				Why Inferno? Her answer simply is "Because it works. I'm all about high intensity and you work with your own body weight.”  Julia teaches in Miami with great enthusiasm and has a strong desire to help her students develop optimal health and vitality in their lives.</p>
