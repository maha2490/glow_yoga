					<h3>Raquel Pelayo BRANCH TEST</h3>
					<h4>Bikram Yoga / Bikram 60</h4>
					<p>This Miami native began practicing Bikram Yoga at the age of 19.  Not knowing much about yoga, Raquel found her first class extremely challenging, as most first time students do.  After class she felt euphoric, untouchable and completely at peace. Her experience was other worldly and divine, having crossed some sort of threshold with no going back.  She was hooked.
					<br>
					Raquel practiced everyday for a month and only wanted more. At the time, she was a student at the University of Central Florida and at home for the holidays. When she returned to school in Orlando, she found her local Bikram Yoga studio and continued her daily practice.  Everything revolved around yoga. She had found magic, glowing from within. 
					<br>
					Slightly clueless as to what college degree she wanted to pursue, Raquel chose the path of business which had opened an entrepreneurship division her senior year. During a lecture, her wise professor spoke life changing words, “Follow your passion and create a business doing what you love.” Raquel was ignited. She clearly knew the answer as she asked herself, “What do I love? Yoga!” Her path was revealed. 
					<br>
					Raquel graduated from UCF in 2006. One month later, she enthusiastically attended Bikram Yoga College of India in Los Angeles to attain her teacher certification. She returned home 9 weeks later and immediately began her teaching career in Aventura, FL. She has been a full time Bikram yoga teacher for 10 years and is now the humble yet proud owner of Glow hot yoga in Miami Beach.  This is a dream come true for Raquel, who has long envisioned the sanctuary for her and her growing family of yogis. 
					<br>
					“I have chosen to teach yoga because I feel a deep inner urge to help others experience what I have experienced in my practice. We need to shift our focus inward and yoga allows us to do just that. Through daily asana practice, we are able to renew the body, love the self, and evolve the spirit.”

					<h3>John Elliott</h3>
					<h4>Bikram Yoga / Bikram 60</h4>
					<p>John’s yoga journey began in 2001 in an effort to heal old discomforting injuries.  He was in search of a more physical holistic approach to build strength and avoid surgery. John connected with Bikram yoga, finding the series beneficial for building strong healthy body and mind.  In fall of 2003, John completed his teacher certification for Bikram yoga.  His personal story inspired him to teach, as he knew first hand the healing power of a consistent dedicated daily yoga practice.  Johns passion for the practice grows as he observes and guides his students through their own experience, bearing witness to constant progress and evolution.  Today, John is pain free and believes “the yoga just works,” as he saw the change in himself and continues to see it in others.  Now a world traveling instructor, Johns knowledge, humor, and contagious enthusiasm will make you crave his class, as he always leaves you challenged and wanting more.</p>

					<h3>Francesca Petrecca</h3>
					<h4>Bikram Yoga / Bikram 60</h4>
					<p>Francesca was born in Napoli, Italy, and moved to the US in 2001. She began her yoga practice in 2006 in efforts to improve her flexibility while riding jumper and race horses.  After a severe injury during a horse race, she turned to Bikram yoga for rehabilitation.  As she continued her yoga practice, Francesca started feeling great improvement with her herniated disc, body flexibility, and mental well-being.  She decided to put all her attention on becoming a yoga instructor in hopes of helping others heal with this ancient art as she did.  Francesca moved to Miami from Brooklyn in August 2012.  From there, she quickly traveled to Los Angeles for her Bikram Yoga Teacher Certification.  Now an energized, passionate and strong teacher, she is happy and grateful to be spreading this beautiful practice, eager as ever to learn, grow and inspire students in their experience of the magic she herself continues to enjoy.  In April 2015, Francesca became the mother to a beautiful baby girl named Oriana.  Through daily practice with her mother, Oriana is already learning breath meditation and many asanas.  Francesca feels deeply blessed with this amazing miracle of life! </p>

					<h3>Lina Dinkova</h3>
					<h4>Bikram Yoga / Bikram 60</h4>
					<p>Lina was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and moved to Miami, FL in her early teens.  A few years later, she discovered the practice of hot yoga, which became a vital part of her life.  She remained a practitioner for about 8 years before deciding to become a teacher.  She attended the strenuous and sweaty "Bikram Yoga Teacher Training 2014" in California.  The call for this pivotal step came from the realization that practicing yoga has changed her life in so many positive ways and continues to do so everyday.  Since then, Lina has traveled on numerous occasions to Costa Rica and California for yoga retreats, fully immersing herself in various spiritual and health disciplines such as: raw food diet, vegan diet, meditation, sun gazing, restorative yoga, kundalini yoga, yin yoga, qi gong (life energy cultivation), earthing (walking barefoot), breathing techniques, plant medicine, appreciation for nature, non-judgement and compassion.  Lina is a cheery, compassionate and detail oriented instructor, making her an ideal match for beginner students as well as more experienced practitioners.<br>
					<br>	
					"I like my students to have fun in my classes, gaining a deeper understanding of the practice of yoga and leaving with 100% of what they came for: that feeling of well being and accomplishment, the ability to quiet the mind and realize how much they are really capable of.”</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who wanted to integrate three very important aspects of his life.  Body, mind and spirit.  The search began when one good day he discovered a book about metaphysics in his native Puerto Rico.  He found the information provided by this book and many others so amazing that it opened a whole new way of thinking, reminding him of how powerful human beings truly are.  The search continued and one thing let to another until one day, watching TV in Chicago, he came across a tall and skinny woman with a sweet voice doing a series of stretches. “WOW" he said to himself, “This looks interesting.”  He began stretching with her and soon learned these stretches were called Yoga!!  After a decade of consistent practice, Willy became a certified vinyasa instructor and has been teaching for 10 years.</p>
